# TODO

  for this, or something similar

- bitbucket pipeline

- logging configuration

## Distant future

- this is the web application and the API server – split it up!

## Things to remember

- when there is an API, it would like OpenAPI documentation.

## Magical counter spike

1. Web page displays a counter.
2. Web page displays a button.
3. When you press the button the number goes up locally.
4. This is synced across all browsers.
