# TODO

- favicon
- git SHA based cache headers for static content – there's a sbt-web plugin
  for this, or something similar
- compression
- test that the sourcemaps work (how do they work lol)
- authentication
- coordinated shutdown
- logging configuration

## Distant future

- this is the web application and the API server – split it up!

## Things to remember

- when there is an API, it would like OpenAPI documentation.
